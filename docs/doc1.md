CryptoComix is a small local comic book shop.

In the late 90s, early 2000's comic books were still big business.

As digital has taken hold, what were once city or nation-wide chains of comic shops have splintered, but the local comic shop is alive and well. There is still a strong consumer base for old school books, indie books, and collectibles. Their communities are driven by local shops, where they also congregate to buy books, play games, and spend time with their friends.

Hit especially hard by COVID, CryptoComix is struggling to make rent without their usual foot traffic, and there are a few hundred community members super bummed that the place might close.

*Can we DAO this up to save CryptoComix?*
