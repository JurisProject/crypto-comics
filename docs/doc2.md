Comic book shops are both a community and a business. So are DAOs. We want the CryptoComix community to **have a voice as well as a stake in the shop's success** (governance and skin in the game). The outcome we are looking for from this is that community members **take action to contribute** to the comic book shop's success. The end-game is that **CryptoComix, a DAO, is owned and operated by and for the community**.

## Contributing

There are many ways to contribute to CryptoComics. These include, but are not limited to...

### Contributing with time/labor

Just like running any business, running a comic book shop is non-trivial. We can't expect everyone to do everything, but we can identify things that the community can contribute to immediately. This might include, but not be limited to:

- Running events (D&D stuff, meetups, and stuff).
- Shipping products (literally just putting stuff in a box, dropping it off at the post office, and paying for it to go to customers).
- Updating the website.
- Designing the CryptoComics DAO.
- Hanging out at the store to help in person customers (if there even is a store).
- Creating merch and/or digital items based on CryptoComics and/or products it sells or has licensing rights to use.

### Contributing with capital

The CryptoComix community can support the shop by paying a yearly membership due as well as by buying stuff. Members would have increased opportunities and incentives to spend money with CryptoComix including, but not limited to:

- Discounts on events and/or special seats/access (think VIP club).
- First right of refusal on new and/or limited edition items.
- Free shipping (think Amazon Prime).
- Discounts on any and all purchases (think Costco).
- Subscription to a comic of the month club/community (comics + reading group).

### Contributing by holding CryptoComix tokens

If we choose an inflationary token supply schedule (big if), then simply holding the DAO token (and not cashing out) supports all the other contributors. As you hold you token your proportional share of the token supply decreases. Also, if you don't sell (either on a secondary market or via redemptions against the DAO's assets) then you're helping to keep the price/value of the token by not taking action to move it down.

## Aligning Incentives

Whenever someone takes action to support CryptoComix they should get a stake in the DAO. The distribution policy for rewards would need to be simple. The simpler the better.

One way to achieve this might be to set a monthly budget for DAO token minting. Then the DAO could allocate that budget to support various initiatives. This way there's a continuous supply of tokens to support operations, regardless of what the token price/value might be. In addition, by rewarding contributors with DAO tokens the default is to hold, which supports the DAO. People have to take action to sell, which then depreciates the DAO's AUM and/or the market price of the token.

## Legal Considerations

CryptoComix aims to be a non-profit cooperative. This would limit liability and allow the entity to engage in contracts. The internet says that [There is no single definition of a cooperative](https://www.co-oplaw.org/co-op-basics/what-are-cooperatives/). That being said, here is one definition of the term:

- *“A cooperative is an organization established for the purpose of purchasing and marketing the products of its members, i.e., shareholders, and/or procuring supplies for resale to the members, whose profits are distributed to the members (in the form of patronage dividends), not on the basis of the members’ equity investment in the cooperative, but in proportion to their patronage of it, i.e., the amount of business that each member transacts with it. In a workers’ cooperative, the members jointly manufacture a product and share in the profits of the enterprise based on the amount of labor they contribute.”*

The seminal Tax Court case Puget Sound Plywood, Inc. v. Commissioner (44 T.C. 305, 308 (1965) set forth three core factors of cooperative associations on the basis of the Rochdale Principles. They are generally accepted as a framework for determining whether an organization is operating on a cooperative basis within the meaning of the tax code.(See also: Jimmy Kroger, The New Frontier: Tax Implications of Limited Cooperative Associations, Fed. B.A. Sec. Tax’n Rep., Summer 2009, at 4, 10.)

- “**Subordination of capital**, both as regards control over the cooperative undertaking, and as regards the ownership of the pecuniary benefits arising therefrom;
- **Democratic control** by the worker-members themselves; and
- The vesting in and the **allocation among the worker-members of all fruits and increases arising** from their cooperative endeavor (i.e., the excess of the operating revenues over the costs incurred in generating those revenues), **in proportion to the worker-members’ active participation** in the cooperative endeavor.”(Puget Sound Plywood, Inc. v. C. I. R., 44 T.C. 305, 308 (T.C. 1965) acq., 1966-2 C.B. 3 (1966).)

“Patronage” is the term that describes how the patrons use the cooperative.  So, for example, the patronage of a consumer cooperative is the purchase of goods from the cooperative; patronage of a producer cooperative is the transfer of goods to the cooperative to be marketed by the cooperative; patronage of a worker cooperative is the work performed for the cooperative.  There is a great deal of flexibility for cooperatives to define patronage and how it is measured.  For example, one worker cooperative might define patronage as the number of hours worked in a fiscal year while another might define patronage as the amount of money earned by a worker in a fiscal year.

All of this seems to point to a modified Moloch style membership organization being a viable candidate for a cooperative DAO. If we can create an on-chain representation of this org structure, then we might be able to create [a legal agreement that defers to on-chain information as a source of truth for the entity](https://github.com/lexDAO/SCoDA-Simple-Code-Deference-Agreement-/). This would reduce overhead and paper pushing, making it easier for people to spin up and run these DAOified cooperatives. More research is required to determine if this is possible, and if so, how we can make this easy to setup.
