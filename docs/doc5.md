#### Can cooperatives have permissioned membership, or do they have to be open to the public?

- **If permissioned:** Members can join the cooperative by submitting a request to join along with 100 DAI. Current members will then vote to approve or deny the new member. Members can also submit proposals for work to be done and decisions to be made.
- **If public:** Members can join the cooperative by paying a membership fee of 100 DAI. A current member will need to process their request on-chain (similar to how an REI employee processes a new membership request) before they can join.

#### Are there requirements as to the identity and/or legal status of members? Do they have to verify that they live in-state or anything?

- **If no state ID is required:** New members will need to provide a proof of uniqueness to verify that they are, indeed, a real person. This might look like a vote of approval from a current member, a Web3 identity profile (3Box, BrightID, Upala, etc), or a social media account such as GitHub or Twitter.
- **If state ID is required:** We'll need to integrate with KYC provider or something. How do cooperatives do this currently?

#### What is actually required to create a CAO legal template?

- Does the [Juris](https://getjuris.com/) software have an API we can plug into?
- Will the software mail the forms to the state, or do users need to do that themselves?
