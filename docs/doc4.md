## Behold!

[A Rinkeby DAO for the CryptoComix cooperative](https://rinkeby.aragon.org/#/cryptocomixxx/)!

- Aragon Membership template with `CCC` as the membership token.
- Token-request to offer DAI in exchange for membership.
- A non-transferable `KAPOW` token that has magnitude as well as a vault with redemptions that's tied to it.

> Note: while we could set this up as two separate DAOs (Membership and Moloch), giving `CCC` tokens control over `KAPOW` minting/burning ensures that a concentration of power in the `KAPOW` tokens doesn't skew incentives/governance for the entire cooperative (esp when it comes to member rewards).
