# Crypto Comics Hackathon

## Welcome ðŸ‘‹

Hey!

I'm Kerp. Co-founder of the Juris Project, a member of LexDAO and Raid Guild, and a lifelong comic nerd.

I have a my local shop, and I'm friends with the owner/manager. If this works, maybe we can get her to DAO up the shop!

This hackathon project is based on a real life use case I suspect exists in cities across globe, but building it out will also tackle a lot of the challenges that DAOs will face as we push toward mass adoption.

Also, think of all the delicious memes!

More details below. Get me on Discord or Twitter (@thekerp) is this sounds like fun.

# Crypto Comics!!

Crypto Comics is a small local comic book shop.

In the late 90s, early 2000's comic books were still big business. 

As digital has taken hold, what were once city or nation-wide chains of comic shops have splintered, but the local comic shop is alive and well. There is still a strong consumer base for old school books, indie books, and collectibles. Their communities are driven by local shops, where they also congregate to buy books, play games, and spend time with their friends.

Hit especially hard by COVID, Crypto Comics is struggling to make rent without their usual foot traffic, and there are a few hundred community members super bummed that the place might close.

Here is my challenge to the Hack for Freedom community: 

Can we DAO this up to save Crypto Comics?

Some questions:
- Can we introduce community ownership of the Comic Shop itself?
    - Can we chare profits?
    - What other benefits can we build in?
- Can the pledge process provide working capital enough to run a shop like this?
- Can we automate all of the paperwork?
- Where else can we get weird with it?

And most importantly:
- Can we do all of this without needing to explain Web3 to a single person who doesn't want to know?
    - All dApps are in need of a "wallet-less" user path, let's hack on it!

That's what I've got so far. Happy to jam on other takes.

Excelsior!

Still Kerp
