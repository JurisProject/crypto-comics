This hackathon project is based on a real life use case I suspect exists in cities across globe.

# Crypto Comics!!

Crypto comics is a small local comic book shop. In the late 90s, early 2000's comic books were still big business. As digital has taken hold, what were once city or nation-wide chains of comic shops have splintered, but the local comic shop is alive and well. There is still a strong consumer base for old school books, indie books, and collectibles. But they like their local shops, where they also congregate to play games, and enjoy the community.

Hit especially hard by COVID, a lot of local stores like this are now finding themselves struggling to make rent as their infrastrucure is build around local, and in-person community.

Here is my challenge to the Hack for Freedom community: can we DAO this up to save Crypto Comics?

Some questions:
- Can we introduce community ownership of the Comic Shop itself?
    - Can we chare profits?
    - What other benefits can we build in?
- Can the pledge process provide working capital enough to run a shop like this?
- Can we automate all of the paperwork?
- Where else can we get weird with it?

And most importantly:
- Can we do all of this without needing to explain Web3 to a single person who doesn't want to know?
    - All dApps are in need of a "wallet-less" user path, let's hack on it!

That's what I've got so far. Happy to jam on other takes.
